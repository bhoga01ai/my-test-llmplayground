User: Update the terminology to replace "AI provider" with "model provider" and "model selection" with "model". Ensure all referenced models are the latest available versions from each provider, excluding any deprecated models. Maintain compatibility with current system requirements while implementing these changes.

User: can you use model list form below text: Of course. Here is a list of the current, non-deprecated models from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and the open-source models available on Groq's platform, presented in a tabular format with their actual API model names.

User: # `https://console.groq.com/docs/models` , use this page to get models for groq model provider and then update the page

User: use models from the screen shot google provider and then update the model selection

User: Design an attractive title section with a visually appealing background that enhances the overall user experience. Ensure the title is prominently displayed with appropriate typography and styling, while the background complements the content without distracting from it. The design should be responsive and maintain visual consistency across different screen sizes.

Implemented: Created an attractive hero section with animated gradient background, featuring:
- Animated gradient background with glassmorphism effects
- Prominent "LLM Playground" title with gradient text
- Descriptive subtitle and provider feature tags
- Robot icon with backdrop blur effects
- Fully responsive design for mobile and tablet
- Smooth animations and hover effects

User: can you create title section at the top of the page that spans all three panes instead of placing it just in the middle

Implemented: Restructured the layout to move the hero section to span across all three panes:
- Moved hero section outside of chat container to top of page
- Updated app-container to use flex-direction: column
- Created main-layout wrapper for sidebar, chat, and config panels
- Adjusted hero section styling to span full width
- Removed margins and border-radius for seamless top placement

User: Create a unified title section that spans across the left navigation pane, main chat panel, and model parameters pane. Ensure the title is prominently displayed and visually consistent across all three sections while maintaining a clean and professional design.

User: Center-align the title "LLM PlaygroundAI Model Explorer" on the page and extend the title section to span across the entire width above the model parameters pane. Ensure the title maintains proper visibility and alignment with the overall page layout.

User: can you move "chat input area" to midle of the page and also few default prompts for user to click and an run it

User: Design a layout where the default prompts are positioned below the chat input area in 2 rows, with 4 prompts per row. Ensure the prompts are evenly spaced and aligned using a proper grid layout. When any default prompt is clicked, its content should be inserted into the chat input area without displacing or altering the position of the chat interface. Maintain the chat area's fixed location at all times.

User: Develop a backend service that utilizes environment variables from a .env file to dynamically interact with AI models. The implementation should: 
 
 1. Load and validate required API keys and configurations from the .env file 
 2. Accept user prompts and selected model preferences as input 
 3. Route requests to the appropriate model API based on user selection 
 4. Include all necessary model parameters (temperature, max_tokens, etc.) in API calls 
 5. Handle API responses and return them to the user 
 6. Implement proper error handling for invalid configurations or API failures 
 
 Ensure the code securely manages API keys and follows best practices for environment variable usage. The solution should be modular to easily accommodate additional models in the future.

User: remove # Cohere Configuration 
 COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here 
 COHERE_BASE_URL= `https://api.cohere.ai`  and GROQ Models

User: can you start the frontend app

User: can you update both UI and back end to use respective models as per below Groq:

 OPENAI: 
 gpt-4 
 gpt-4-turbo

 claude-sonnet-4-20250514

User: can you add google provider and its models to UI and backend

User: can you test the front app throughtly using default prompts?

User: nothing is working
User: user selects the default prompt and enter , it is not giving the reponse yet.

User: can you test the front app throughtly using default prompts?

User: Re-add the Google provider and its models to both the UI and backend. Make sure it's properly configured and working alongside the existing providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq).

RESOLUTION: Fixed model-provider synchronization issue in script.js
- Added event listener for modelSelect changes to update currentConfig.model
- Modified updateModelOptions to automatically set the first model when provider changes
- Ensured frontend sends correct model-provider combinations
- Test results: 15/17 tests passing (88.2%) - validation errors resolved

RESOLUTION: Fixed Groq API base URL configuration issue
- Problem: GROQ_BASE_URL was set to 'https://api.groq.com/v1' instead of 'https://api.groq.com/openai/v1'
- Solution: Updated .env file with correct Groq base URL that follows OpenAI-compatible format
- Result: Groq provider now working correctly, test results improved to 16/17 tests passing (94.1%)
- Only remaining failure is Anthropic parameter conflict (temperature + top_p), not API connectivity
